Door Counter
============

EC450 Spring 2014 Final Project

This program uses an MSP430 and photoresistors to count the number of people who have walked through a doorway.

How to use
----------

This repo includes only main.c.

To run, use Code Composer Studio and create a new MSP430 project.

Replace the default main.c with this main.c, and then use the debugger to load the program onto the MSP430.
